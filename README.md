# GameBehaviorToPsychologicalDifferences-DataFest2022
Created visualizations and K-Nearest Neighbors model to study relationship between game play behaviour and performance in categories such as education, future aspirations, and more.

Code and findings were presented at ASA Datafest 2022 and received Judge's Pick.

**user_scores_per_period.py**

We were given survey data that shows the learning progress of each student as they were playing the game called s5. 
The students participating in the study took the survey ever three weeks as they were making their way through the 
game. 

I built user_scores_per_period.py to match the score obtained by a student within the each time period before they
were asked to take the survey. The results are displayed in this diagram:

The libraries mainly used in the code were pandas and seaborn. 

The goal of this was to see if there is a relationship between progress made within the game, and improvement in the scores. 
If a point is high on the y-axis, it means the student spent more time playing the game, and therefore was rewarded points. If the points
that are high on the y-axis were also far to the right on the x-axis, indicating a high survey score, it might be an indicator that the 
game had a positive effect on the traits looked for by the survey. 

We were ble to find that over the weeks, students gained the most game points within week 3, 6, and 12, but there was no significant general movement on the survey scores. Then in week 24 all of the students' survey scores were concentrated far to the right on the graphs, showing a general improvement. 

A next step would be to consider other factors that could have caused better survey performance on drug and alchohol abuse knowledge
that could have developed in the 12 weeks before the '24 week' survey was taken. 

cubic_model_relationship.py
In this piece of code, I created a cubic model to find a relationship between student behavior within the game, and their profile. A student's profile is composed of their answers to questions like education level and salary expectation.

 This means the model reached 99.0 for preditions. Our group suspects there is an error somewhere in the code enabling this. However, based on this, we assumed there is a correlation between game score and profiles made by the students. By looking through the data further and building more filters, we were able to identify a pattern where higher points achieved within the game, which is only possible through spending more time in the game, was obtained by students with higher education expectations and career salary.
